## General

This repository contains examples for [React-Bootstrap](https://github.com/react-bootstrap/react-bootstrap) in combination with different build setups which you can directly try out with CodeSandbox in your browser.

## Adding a new example

- Each example, has its own folder which shows the usage in a minimal setup
- It's tested via GitHub Actions, so it needs to be added to [.github/workflows/test-examples.yml](.github/workflows/test-examples.yml)
- There should be a small description in the example's directory with a description
- And referred to it in the README with a short description
